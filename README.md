# Movie Trailer Website

A Movie Trailer Website where users can watch the trailers of the best dramas that are between the
    today's date and the date as of 3 years ago.
 
### Primary Objectives
- [x] Dynamically generated from a Python data structure.
- [x] Page presents movie title, box art and trailer link.
- [x] Use an API to automatically get movie data.
- [x] Website renders properly and shows at least 6 movies.
- [x] Make Python file open error-free.

# What's included

Excluding this `README.md` file there are three python files:

  - **start.py** - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
   the web page.
  - **just_movies.py** - Wweb page generator.
  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
  
A fourth file, `just_movies.html`, will be generated when you run the program as described above.
This file is the actual web page you would see in your browser.

### Extras
This project uses Python to query [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en)
for best dramas.  The Bootstrap 4 is used for basic styling.
